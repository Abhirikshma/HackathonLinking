- Data from individual `.root` files (ntuples) read, processed and saved as pickled files in `1-DataPreparation.ipynb`.
- Graph visualization in `3-Visualization.ipynb`, but requires the trained model and the custom model class. 
- (TODO: Seprate the model class declaration from training and validation and put in `/model`).
